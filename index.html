    <h3>Team based in Boston</h3>

    <p>
      (/' seltiks/ SEL-tiks ) are an American professional basketball team
      based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball
      Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic
      Division. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the
      Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, which they share with the
      National Hockey League's Boston Bruins.

    <h2>One of the most successful basketball teams in NBA</h2>

    <p>
      The Celtics are regarded as one of the most successful basketball teams in
      NBA history; the team is tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA
      Championships won with 17 (accounting for 23.6 percent of all NBA
      championships since the league's founding) and currently holds the record
      for the most recorded wins of any NBA team. [10] [11] The Celtics are one
      of the two charter franchises (the other is the New York Knicks) still
      playing in their original city.

    <h3>Celtics&#39; star, Larry Bird</h3>

    <p>
      The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, which was
      heavily highlighted throughout the 1960s and 1980s. Including their
      two-team/ many match-ups in the 1980s, the Celtics' star, Larry Bird, and
      the Lakers' star, Magic Johnson, had an ongoing feud. The franchise has
      played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals (including their

      most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won
      nine. [12] Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and
      Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA-record
      total of 10 MVP awards. [13] Both the nickname "Celtics" and their mascot
      "Lucky the Leprechaun" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish
      population, as well as to the Original Celtics, a marquee team prior to
      the NBA. [14]
